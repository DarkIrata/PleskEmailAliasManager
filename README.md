# Plesk Email Alias Manager
This tool is a product of a quick solution to create mail alias accounts for e-mail addresses hosted with PLESK using the XML API.
The tool is providing minimum support and only handles the alias use case.
With Version 2 i rewrote everything in .net 6 and cleaned it up so it can, if needed, be adjusted / extendet easily.

Feel free to use / adjust as needed.
